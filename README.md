# How does it works?

So how does the app actually work? Imagine a fresh graduate student, Ernie, decides to look for a job and 
applied at Excite Media Services. Ernie was able to show his outstanding skills and unmatched work ethics so 
he got hired in Excite Media Services. Human Resource personnel, Mon, recorded ernie's credential and 
explained to Ernie that EMS has point system. Mon explained some important guidelines to Ernie.

**5 rules of Thanks Point system**

- Every year, each and every account points will reset their account points to 3points
- Whenever a co-worker helps an individual, The individual can give a point as a sign of token of 
    appreciation for his / her help.
- Per account, he / she can only give 1 point every month
- If an account reach 10 points, he / she will be eligible to convert 10 points into 1000 pesos
- Every account cannot send to the account who sent him points last month.
    
    **Example Given:**

        Ernie gave Lee 1 point for helping him fix the bug in one task of their project for the month of march.
        When the month of April comes, Lee cannot give a point to Ernie even though Ernie helped him.

Ernie eventually reached 10 points for helping. He then approached Accounting Officer to claim the 
1000 pesos in exchange for 10 points. Accounting verify the points history to ensure his claim is correct and
untarnished.

Mon also stated that the company has Administrator Accounts. Namely General Manager, Assistant Manager, Accounting
Manager, Administrators. These administrators are here to ensure the growth of the company, growth of the employees
and project completion. Only the Administrators has the access to Point System History. By using the Point System 
Transaction History, Administrators to gauge how interactive the employees has been, willingness to help others.
Of course, the most helpful employees will receive a special award or token of appreciation for helping others at 
the end of the year Christmas Party. 


**NOTE:** Administrators are not eligible in points system due to conflict of interest
